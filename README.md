Restangular
===========

This project demonstrates how nicely Jersey & AngularJS interact.

## Usage

From the project root, run :

    mvn package

Maven will create an auto-executable jar named restangular-1.0.jar in the `target` subdirectory.

The embedded web server can be run with :

     java -jar restangular-1.0.jar

The application is then available at : `http://localhost:8000/web/index.html`.



## Frameworks

* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) is a Javascript framework developed by Google.
* [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net) is the reference implementation of JAX-RS.
